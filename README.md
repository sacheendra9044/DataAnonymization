# DataAnonymization

Data Privacy, also known as Information Privacy, is the aspect of Information Technology, that
deals with the ability of an organization to share the information or data in the computer system
with the third parties.
This project is divided into two phases.

The first phase discusses the definition of data protection, the need for data protection, how
does the data protection work and the three important data protection or data anonymization
techniques which are k-anonymity, l-diversity and t-closeness. The k-anonymity privacy
requirement for publishing microdata requires that each equivalence class in the data-set
contains at least k records. L-diversity requires that each equivalence class in the data-set must
have at least t distinct values for the sensitive attribute. The concept of t-closeness requires that
the distribution of sensitive attribute in the anonymized data is close to its distribution in the
whole data-set by a metric known as Earth Mover Distance.

The second phase of the project discusses whether Machine Learning could be incorporated on
the anonymized data to extract the sensitive feature which in turn can reveal the identity of a
record in the dataset. Also, the second phase will let us know the possible attacks a third party
can try to extract the sensitive feature. This would help us to evaluate the usefulness and
accuracy of the current prevailing data anonymization techniques and would help us judge
whether the current prevailing data-anonymization methods are worth or not. If they fail, then
what could be done to prevent the data from revealing the identity of a person.
